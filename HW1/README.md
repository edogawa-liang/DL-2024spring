### File Description
- `HW1.ipynb`: Coordinates the workflow of the image classification task, using *KNN*, *Random Forest*, *AdaBoost* and *SVM*.
- `imgModule.py`: Provides functionalities for the task:
    - **OpenImageFile**: Reads image files.
    - **FeatureExtractor**: Uses *Color histograms*, *HOG*, *BRISK*, *ORB* for feature extraction.
    - **ModelingEvaluate**: Supports modeling and evaluation to select the best model.
