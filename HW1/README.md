### Contents 
This project showcases a complete image classification task workflow through the combination of the `HW1.ipynb` Jupyter notebook and the `imgModule.py` Python module. The process starts with data preparation, goes through feature extraction, and ends with modeling and evaluation.


### File Description
- `HW1.ipynb`: Coordinates the entire workflow of the image classification task, employing models such as *KNN*, *Random Forest*, *AdaBoost* and *SVM* to accomplish the task of classifying images.

- `imgModule.py`: Provides functionalities for the task:
    - **OpenImageFile**: Reads image files.
    - **FeatureExtractor**: Uses *Color histograms*, *HOG*, *BRISK*, *ORB* for feature extraction.
    - **ModelingEvaluate**: Supports modeling and evaluation to select the best model.
    
- `DL_hw1_LiangJen.pdf`: Report for the assignment.
